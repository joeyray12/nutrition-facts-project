# Nutrition Facts Tracker


## Description
As a group we developed a web page that will accurately supply you with nutritional information of any food that is entered into the search bar provided. Once the information is entered into the search bar you will also be presented with an image of the food you had searched. The side of the page will track the items that have previously been searched, and when you click on one of the past searches it will re-enter it into the page. 


## Installation
You will be able ot access this tracker from the webpage provided here: https://joeyray12.github.io/nutrition-facts-project/

## Usage
This page can now be utilized by anyone who would be interested in an easily accessible nutrition tracker to accurately list their daily nutrition. This page can also be utilized to plan out a daily or weekly meal schedule with the items being tracked to your local storage.
